$(".cat").on("click", function() {
	alert("Test");
	// add physics to items
	// move relevant items up to top using animation
});

// because I'm working with the physics library created by Mr. Doob,
// a lot of the javascript will be playing with it and figuring out what works
// so unfortunately it's hard for me to put much pseudo-code here
